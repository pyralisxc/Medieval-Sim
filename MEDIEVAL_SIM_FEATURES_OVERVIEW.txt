Item and Object Commands:
- Spawn items and objects
- Modify item properties
- Bulk item operations
- Inventory management

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Browse commands by category instead of searching through documentation
- Fill out forms instead of typing complex command syntax
- See all available options for each parameter
- Preview commands before executing them
- Get immediate feedback on results

TECHNICAL BENEFITS:
- Uses reflection to automatically discover new commands as Necesse updates
- Adapts to new command parameters without mod updates
- Reduces human error in command execution
- Provides consistent interface across all commands

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. SETTLEMENT SPACING SYSTEM
============================

WHAT IT DOES:
- Increases the minimum distance required between player settlements
- Prevents settlements from being built too close together
- Helps reduce conflicts over territory and resources

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
- Adds 50 additional tiles of required spacing between settlements

- Maintains existing settlements (doesn't affect already-built settlements)
- Provides clear error messages when placement fails

BENEFITS:
- Reduces territorial disputes between players
- Encourages players to plan settlements more carefully
- Creates natural buffer zones between communities
- Prevents accidental blocking of settlement expansion
- Makes the world feel less crowded and more realistic

USER EXPERIENCE:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. PLOT FLAG SYSTEM (FUTURE FEATURE)
====================================

WHAT IT WILL DO:
- Allow administrators to create purchasable settlement plots
- Enable controlled settlement expansion through an economy system
- Provide customizable pricing for different plot locations

HOW IT WILL WORK:

Plot Creation:
- Administrators purchase special "Plot Flag" items

- Place plot flags in desired locations around the world

Player Experience:

- Manage settlement expansion in a controlled way

BENEFITS:
- Creates an economic aspect to settlement creation
- Allows administrators to control where settlements can be built
- Generates currency sinks for the server economy
