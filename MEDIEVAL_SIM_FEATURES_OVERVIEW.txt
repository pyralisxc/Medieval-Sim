- Provides visual forms with dropdowns, checkboxes, and input fields instead of text commands
- Makes advanced server management accessible to non-technical administrators

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES:
- Necesse has many powerful console commands, but they're hard to use

- Easy to make mistakes that could affect the server
- New administrators struggle to learn all the available commands

THE SOLUTION:
- Scans all available Necesse commands automatically

- Inventory management

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Browse commands by category instead of searching through documentation
- Fill out forms instead of typing complex command syntax
- See all available options for each parameter
- Preview commands before executing them
- Get immediate feedback on results

TECHNICAL BENEFITS:
- Uses reflection to automatically discover new commands as Necesse updates
- Adapts to new command parameters without mod updates
- Reduces human error in command execution
- Provides consistent interface across all commands

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. SETTLEMENT SPACING SYSTEM
============================

WHAT IT DOES:
- Increases the minimum distance required between player settlements
- Prevents settlements from being built too close together
- Helps reduce conflicts over territory and resources
- Encourages proper town planning and expansion

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
- Adds 50 additional tiles of required spacing between settlements
- Prevents both new settlement creation and expansion if too close to existing settlements
- Maintains existing settlements (doesn't affect already-built settlements)
- Provides clear error messages when placement fails

BENEFITS:
- Reduces territorial disputes between players
- Encourages players to plan settlements more carefully
- Creates natural buffer zones between communities
- Prevents accidental blocking of settlement expansion
- Makes the world feel less crowded and more realistic

USER EXPERIENCE:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. PLOT FLAG SYSTEM
===================

WHAT IT DOES:
- Allows administrators to create purchasable settlement plots
- Enables controlled settlement expansion through an economy system
- Provides customizable pricing for different plot locations

HOW IT WORKS:

Plot Creation:
- Administrators purchase special "Plot Flag" items from the shop
- Plot flags cost configurable amount of coins (default: 1000 coins)
- Place plot flags in desired locations around the world
- Plot flags respect settlement spacing rules

Player Experience:
- Players find plot flags placed by administrators
- Right-click plot flag to see purchase price
- Spend in-game currency to buy the plot
- Plot flag automatically converts to settlement flag upon purchase
- Purchaser becomes the settlement owner

Administrative Control:
- Set coin cost via mod settings (ModConfig.PlotFlags.coinCost)
- Enable/disable plot flag system globally (ModConfig.PlotFlags.enabled)
- When enabled, normal settlement flags cannot be purchased/placed
- Plot flags respect settlement spacing configuration
- Remove or replace plots as needed

BENEFITS:
- Creates an economic aspect to settlement creation
- Allows administrators to control where settlements can be built
- Generates currency sinks for the server economy
- Enables strategic placement of settlements in desirable locations
- Prevents random settlement sprawl

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. SETTLEMENT PROTECTION SYSTEM
================================

WHAT IT DOES:
- Allows settlement owners to protect their entire settlement from griefing
- Provides granular permission controls similar to Protected Zones
- Automatically applies protection to settlement boundaries
- Shows visual buff indicator when inside protected settlements

WHO CAN USE IT:
- Settlement owners (only the owner can configure protection)
- Settlement members (can be granted permissions by owner)
- Owner's team (can be granted full access)

- Protection follows settlement as it expands

BENEFITS:
- Protects settlements without requiring manual zone creation
- Gives settlement owners control over their own protection
- Simpler than creating Protected Zones for every settlement
